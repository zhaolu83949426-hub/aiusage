## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Desktop system tray widget** — `@juliantanx/aiusage-widget` package with npm publish workflow ([#7](https://github.com/juliantanx/aiusage/pull/7))
- **PM2 background support** — run aiusage as a background service via PM2
- **Cursor tool support** — detect and display Cursor AI tool usage
- **Widget port auto-detection** — widget automatically discovers the backend port
- **Official subscription quota dashboard** — display subscription usage and limits
- **Session detail page** — `/sessions/[sessionId]` with duration, tool call count, and time offset display
- **MCP servers tab** — view top MCP servers in the overview tool calls card
- **Tool call type classification** — filter tool calls by type (built-in, MCP, skill) with tabs on the Tool Calls page
- **Cursor AI consumption support** — parse and display Cursor AI usage data (F1-B)
- **Skill name extraction** — extract specific skill names from Claude Code `Skill` tool_use blocks, with display name classification and info notice for tools without tool call data
- **Improved project name extraction** — use cwd to resolve project names with full path display

### Fixed
- SQL ambiguous column qualifiers (`ts`, `tool`) in sessions queries after LEFT JOIN
- Codex records showing `model=unknown` — parse pre-watermark lines and scan `turn_context` events for backfill
- Negative offset guard in `formatRelativeTs` and empty records state handling
- Strip `skill__` prefix from display names in session detail endpoint
- Escape SQL LIKE underscores to prevent `skill_view` matching `skill__` filter
- Re-backfill `skill__unknown` rows (not just legacy Skill rows)
- Extract skill name from `input.name` when `input.skill` is absent, also check `input.skillName`
- Tool-calls info notice border color (`--blue` instead of invisible `--blue-dim`)
- Validate `toolType` parameter in `/api/tool-calls`
- Always include `tool` and `device` params in session detail URL
- Fall back to `source_file` extraction when cwd-based project name is unknown

### Changed
- Remove unused `aiusage-data` gitlink

---
