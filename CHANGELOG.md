# Changelog

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-21

- Docs page text constrained to 72ch max-width for readability on wide viewports
- `serve` command now handles occupied dev ports gracefully

### Changed
- CI npm auth rewritten to write token directly to `~/.npmrc` instead of relying on `setup-node` registry-url
